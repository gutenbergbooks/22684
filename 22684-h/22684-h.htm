His Majesty the King, under the Seal of the Interior Department,
and shall be signed by the Minister of Interior and
countersigned by the Commissioner of Patents, and they
shall be recorded together with the specifications in the
office of the Interior Department in books kept for the purpose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section</span> 2. Every patent shall contain a short title or
description of the invention or discovery, correctly indicating
its nature and design, and a grant to the patentee, his
heirs or assigns for the term of ten<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a title="Amended to read &quot;fifteen&quot;. Act 27, Laws of 1896."

throughout the Hawaiian Islands, referring to the specification
for the particulars thereof. A copy of the specifications
and drawings shall be annexed to the patent and be a part
thereof.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section</span> 3. Any person who has invented or discovered
any new and useful art, machine, manufacture, process or
composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement
thereof not known or used by others in this country, and not
patented (or described in any printed publication) in this or
any foreign country before his invention or discovery thereof,
may, upon payment of the fees required by law, and other
due proceedings had, obtain a patent therefor. Provided,
however, that any person who has invented or discovered
any new and useful art, machine, manufacture, process or
composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement
thereof, and has received a patent or patents therefor from
any foreign government may also obtain a patent therefor in
this country as provided above, unless the thing patented has
been introduced into public use in the Hawaiian Islands for
more than one year prior to the application for a patent.
But every patent granted for an invention which has been
previously patented in a foreign country, shall be so limited
that it shall not continue longer than the time of the expiration
of such foreign patent, or if there are several foreign
patents, it shall not continue longer than the time of the
expiration of the one with the shortest unexpired term, and
in no case shall it be in force more than ten<a name="FNanchor_A_2" id="FNanchor_A_2"></a><a title="Amended to read &quot;fifteen&quot;. Act 27, Laws of 1896."

<p><span class="smcap">Section</span> 4. Before any inventor or discoverer shall receive
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">p. 3</a></span>a patent for his invention or discovery he shall apply therefor
in writing to the Minister of Interior, and shall file in
the office of the Interior Department a written description of
the same and of the manner and process of making, compounding
and using it, in clear, concise and exact terms and
in case of a machine he shall explain the principle thereof
and of the manner in which he has applied that principle so
as to distinguish it from other inventions, and he shall particularly
point out and distinctly claim the part, improvement
or combination which he claims as his invention or discovery.
When the nature of the case admits of drawings the applicant
shall furnish them as set forth in Section 2. When the
invention or discovery is of a composition of matter, the
applicant shall furnish a specimen of ingredients and of the
composition, sufficient in quantity for the purpose of experiment.
In all cases which admit of representation by model,
the applicant shall, if required, furnish a model of convenient
size to exhibit advantageously the several parts of his invention.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section</span> 5. The applicant shall make oath that he believes
himself to be the original and first inventor or discoverer
of the art, machine, manufacture, composition or
improvement for which he solicits a patent, and that, he does
not know or believe that the same was ever before known or
used, and shall state of what country he is a citizen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section</span> 6. On filing of any such application and the payment
of the fees required by law, the Commissioner of Patents
shall examine the alleged new invention or discovery, and
if upon such examination it shall appear that the claimant
is justly entitled to a patent under the law and that the same
is sufficiently useful and important, he shall report accordingly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">p. 4</a></span>
to the Minister of Interior, who shall cause a patent
to be issued therefor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section</span> 7. Any person who makes any new invention or
discovery, and desires further time to mature the same, may
on payment of the fees required by law, file in the Interior
Department a <i>caveat</i> setting forth the design thereof and its
distinguishing characteristics, and praying protection of his
right until he shall have matured the invention. Such <i>caveat</i>
shall be preserved in secrecy and shall be operative for the
term of one year from the filing thereof.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section</span> 8. The Commissioner of Patents shall be appointed
by the Minister of Interior and shall examine and
report on all applications for patents and shall receive for
such services a fee of twenty dollars for each application examined
and reported by him, which fee shall be paid by the
applicant in advance. In addition to this fee the following
fees shall be charged all applicants for patents, upon filing
each original application for a patent, five dollars; and upon
issuing a patent, five dollars; and five dollars shall be charged
for the filing of a <i>caveat</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section</span> 9. This Act shall take effect and become a law
from and after its publication, and "An Act to amend Section
255 and 256 of the Civil Code, and add a new Section to
the Civil Code to be numbered Section 256a," approved the
twenty-second day of June, A. D. 1868, is hereby repealed.</p>

TWO NEW SECTIONS TO SAID ACT, AS AMENDED
BY AN ACT ENTITLED "AN ACT TO AMEND AN
ACT REGULATING THE ISSUING OF PATENTS,"
APPROVED THE 23RD DAY OF JUNE, 1888, TO BE
CALLED SECTIONS 15 AND 16.</p>

<p class="sub"><i>Be it Enacted by the Legislature of the Republic of Hawaii:</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Section</span> 1. That Section 2 of an Act entitled "An Act to

is hereby amended by striking out the word "ten" and inserting

is hereby amended by striking out the word "ten" and inserting
in its place the word "fifteen," so that said Section as
amended shall read as follows:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Section</span> 3. Any person who has invented or discovered
any new and useful art, machine, manufacture, process or
composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement
thereof not known or used by others in this country, and not
patented (or described in any printed publication) in this or
any foreign country before his invention or discovery thereof,
may, upon payment of the fees required by law, and other
due proceedings had, obtain a patent therefor. Provided,
however, that any person who has invented or discovered any
new and useful art, machine, manufacture, process or composition
of matter, or any new and useful improvement
thereof, and has received a patent or patents therefor from
any foreign government, may also obtain a patent therefor
in this country as provided above, unless the thing patented
has been introduced into public use in the Hawaiian Islands
for more than one year prior to the application for a patent.
But every patent granted for an invention which has been
previously patented in a foreign country, shall be so limited
that it shall not continue longer than the time of the expiration
of such foreign patent, or if there are several foreign
patents, it shall not continue longer than the time of the
expiration of the one with the shortest unexpired term, and
in no case shall it be in force more than fifteen years."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section</span> 3. That a new section to said Act, as amended by
the Act entitled "An Act to amend an Act to regulate the
issuing of Patents," approved June 23rd, 1888, be added, to
be called Section 15.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Section</span> 15. Whenever any patent is inoperative or invalid,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">p. 9</a></span>
by reason of a defective or insufficient specification, or
by reason of the patentee claiming as his own invention or
discovery more than he had a right to claim as new, if the
error has arisen by inadvertance, accident or mistake, and
without any fraudulent or deceptive intention, the Minister
of the Interior shall, on the surrender of such patent and
the payment of the same fees required by law upon the issue
of an original or first patent, cause a new patent for the same
invention, and in accordance with the corrected specification,
to be issued to the patentee, or, in the case of his death, or of
an assignment of the whole or any undivided part of the
original patent, then to his executors, administrators, or assigns,
for the unexpired part of the term of the original patent.
Such surrender shall take effect upon the issue of the
amended patent. The Minister of the Interior may, in his
discretion, upon demand of the applicant, and upon payment
of the same or first fee required to be paid on the issuing of
a patent, cause several patents to be issued for distinct and
separate parts of the thing patented. The specifications and
claim in every such case shall be subject to revision and restriction
in the same manner as original applications are.
Every patent so re-issued, together with the corrected specification,
shall have the same effect and operation in law,
on the trial of all actions for causes thereafter arising, as if
the same had been originally filed in such corrected form;
but no new matter shall be introduced into the specification,
nor in case of a machine patent shall the model or drawings
be amended, except each by the other, but when there is
neither model nor drawing, amendments may be made upon
proof satisfactory to the Minister of the Interior, that such
new matter or amendment was a part of the original invention,
and was omitted from the specification by inadvertance,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">p. 10</a></span>
accident, or mistake, as aforesaid. Upon the filing of
any such application for a re-issue with the Minister of the
Interior, the same examination shall be had as is provided by
Section 6 of the "Act to Regulate the issuing of Patents," approved
August 29th, 1884."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section</span> 4. That a new Section to said Act, as amended by
the Act entitled "An Act to amend an Act to regulate the
issuing of Patents," approved June 23rd, 1888, be added, to
be called Section 16.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Section</span> 16. Patents may be granted and issued and re-issued
to the assignee of the inventor or discoverer, but the
assignment must first be filed in the office of the Minister of
the Interior. And in all cases of an application by an assignee
for the issue of a patent, the application shall be made, and
the specification signed as provided by law by the inventor
or discoverer. And in all cases of an application for a re-issue
of any patent, the application must be made, and the
corrected specification signed by the inventor or discoverer,
if he is living."</p>

<p class="rop">THE SPECIFICATION.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_17" id="Rule_17"></a>17&mdash;The specification is a written description of the invention
or discovery, and of the manner and process of making,
constructing, compounding and using the same, and is required
to be in such full, clear, concise and exact terms as to
enable any person skilled in the art or science to which it
appertains, or with which it is most nearly connected, to

<p><a name="Rule_20" id="Rule_20"></a>20&mdash;The specification must be signed by the inventor or
his attorney, and the signature must be attested by two witnesses.
Full names must be given, and all names, whether of
applicants or witnesses, must be legibly written.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_21" id="Rule_21"></a>21&mdash;All of the papers must be written in a fair, legible
hand, on but one side of the paper, otherwise the office may
require them to be printed. All interlineations and erasures
must be clearly marked in marginal or foot notes, written on
the same page. Legal cap paper, with the lines numbered, is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">p. 22</a></span>
preferable, and a wide margin must be reserved upon the
left hand side of each page of the specification.</p>


<p class="rop">THE OATH.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_22" id="Rule_22"></a>22&mdash;The inventor must make oath that he does verily believe
himself to be the original and first inventor or discoverer
of the art, machine, manufacture, composition or improvement
for which he solicits a patent. That the same has not been
patented to himself or others with his knowledge or consent
in any foreign country, or if the same has been so patented,
the details of, name, country, date, number and term must be
given; and that the same has not to his knowledge been introduced
into public use in the Hawaiian Islands for more
than one year; that he does not know or believe that the same
was ever before known or used, and shall state of what country
he is a citizen, and his place of residence.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_23" id="Rule_23"></a>23&mdash;The oath may be made before any person within this
Republic authorized by law to administer oaths, or when the
applicant resides in any foreign country, before any Minister,
Charge d'Affaires, Consul or Commercial Agent, holding commission
under the Hawaiian Government, or before any
Notary Public in such foreign country, the oath being attested
in all cases by the proper official seal of the officer before
whom oath is made.</p>

<p>When the oath is sworn before any official abroad, other
than a Hawaiian Consul or Agent, a certificate as to the
authority of such official must be obtained from such Consul
or Agent under his official seal and annexed thereto.</p>


<p class="rop">DRAWINGS.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_24" id="Rule_24"></a>24&mdash;The applicant for a patent is required by law to furnish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">p. 23</a></span>
drawings of his invention where the nature of the case
admits of it.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_25" id="Rule_25"></a>25&mdash;The drawings must be signed by the inventor, or his
attorney, and attested by two witnesses, and must show every
feature of the invention covered by claims.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_26" id="Rule_26"></a>26&mdash;The drawings to be in duplicate, one copy on heavy
parchment, the other copy on tracing cloth, the drawings to
be made with india ink of best quality and with pen only,
every line and letter must be black. The size of a sheet on
which a drawing is made should be exactly 10&times;15 inches, one
inch from its edges a single marginal line to be drawn, leaving
the "sight" 8&times;13 inches. Within this margin all work and
signatures must be included, one of the smaller sides of the
sheet is regarded as its top, and measuring downward from
the marginal line a space of not less than 1&frac14; inches is to be
left blank for the insertion of Title, Name, Number and Date.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_27" id="Rule_27"></a>27&mdash;The scale to which a drawing is made should be large
enough to show the mechanism without crowding, and more
than one sheet may be used, if necessary, to accomplish this
end. Letters and figures of reference should be carefully
formed, and large enough to be plainly distinguished. If the
same part of the invention appears in more than one view
of the drawing, it must always be represented by the same
character; and the same character must never be used to
designate different parts.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_28" id="Rule_28"></a>28&mdash;No agent's or attorney's stamp, or advertisement, or
written address, will be permitted upon a drawing.</p>

<p>Should the application be found incomplete under the above
rules and be returned from the Minister of the Interior for
amendment, the same must be again filed within thirty days,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">p. 24</a></span>
if the applicant is a resident of the Hawaiian Islands, or
within four months if residing in a foreign country; otherwise
it will be barred, if interfering with another application
filed during the interval and covering the same invention or
improvement.</p>


<p class="rop">THE MODEL.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_29" id="Rule_29"></a>29&mdash;A model will not be required as part of the application
unless on examination of the case it shall be found to be
necessary or useful; when, if so found, the Commissioner of
Patents shall, in writing, notify the applicant, and action in
the case shall be suspended until a model is furnished.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_30" id="Rule_30"></a>30&mdash;The model must clearly exhibit every feature of the
machine which forms the subject of a claim of invention, but
should not include other matter than that covered by the
actual invention or improvement, unless it shall be necessary
to the exhibition of the invention in a working model.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_31" id="Rule_31"></a>31&mdash;The model must be neatly and substantially made of
durable material, metal being deemed preferable; but when
a material forms an essential feature of the invention, the
model will be constructed of that material.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_32" id="Rule_32"></a>32&mdash;The model must not be more than one foot in length,
width or height, unless the Commissioner of Patents shall
admit working models of complicated machines of larger
dimensions.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_33" id="Rule_33"></a>33&mdash;Models belonging to patented cases will not be taken
from the office except in the custody of a sworn employee
especially authorized by the Commissioner of Patents.</p>
<p class="pn"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">p. 25</a></span></p>

<p class="rop">SPECIMENS.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_34" id="Rule_34"></a>34&mdash;When the invention or discovery is of a composition of
matter the applicant shall furnish a specimen of the composition
and of its ingredients sufficient in quantity for the
purpose of experiment.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_35" id="Rule_35"></a>35&mdash;In all cases where the article is not perishable a specimen
of the composition claimed, put up in proper form to be
preserved in the office must be furnished.</p>


<p class="rop">INTERFERENCES.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_36" id="Rule_36"></a>36&mdash;An interference is a proceeding instituted for the purpose
of determining the question of priority of invention between
two or more parties claiming substantially the same
patentable invention or discovery.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_37" id="Rule_37"></a>37&mdash;If an application filed appears to claim substantially
the same invention for which a <i>caveat</i> has been filed, the Commissioner
of Patents will notify the caveator to complete his
application in three months, and if upon the filing thereof it
appears to be in conflict an interference will be declared. If
the caveator fails to complete his application within the time
designated, or such further time as for cause shown may be
granted to him, the Commissioner of Patents will proceed to
examine the first named application as if there were no <i>caveat</i>.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_38" id="Rule_38"></a>38&mdash;Each party to the interference will be required to file
a concise statement under oath showing the date of his
original conception of the invention, of illustration by drawing
or model, of its disclosure to others of its completion
and of the extent of its use.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_39" id="Rule_39"></a>39&mdash;Testimony in such cases may be taken orally before the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">p. 26</a></span>
Commissioner of Patents, at such time as he may designate,
or it may be taken by commission according to the forms
usual in the Courts of the Republic.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_40" id="Rule_40"></a>40&mdash;After the testimony is closed the case shall be carefully
examined by the Commissioner of Patents and adjudicated
upon the proofs presented.</p>


<p class="rop">CAVEATS.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_41" id="Rule_41"></a>41&mdash;A <i>caveat</i> under the patent law is a notice given to the
office of the caveator's claim as inventor, in order to prevent
the grant of a patent to another for the same alleged invention
upon an application filed during the life of the <i>caveat</i>, without
notice to the caveator.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_42" id="Rule_42"></a>42&mdash;A <i>caveat</i> may be filed in the Interior Department by
any person who has made any new invention or discovery,
and desires further time to mature the same, upon payment
of the fee required by law. Such <i>caveat</i> shall be preserved
in secrecy, and shall be operative for the term of one year
from the date of filing.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_43" id="Rule_43"></a>43&mdash;The <i>caveat</i> must comprise a petition, a specification,
an oath, and when the nature of the case admits of it, a
drawing, and must be limited to a single invention or improvement.
The attest of oath must comply with Rule <a href="#Rule_23">23</a>.</p>


<p class="rop">APPEALS.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_44" id="Rule_44"></a>44&mdash;Appeal from an adverse report of the Commissioner
of Patents lies to the Supreme Court in Banco. The Commissioner
of Patents will furnish, through the Minister of the
Interior, to the applicant or to his attorney, a written statement
of his reasons for such report, whereupon the applicant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">p. 27</a></span>
may amend his application or may, within ninety days after
such written statement is furnished to him or to his attorney,
or mailed in the Post-office at Honolulu, addressed to him or
to his attorney, appeal to the Supreme Court in Banco.</p>

<p>In case of appeal the applicant shall file in the office of
the Minister of the Interior at least twenty days before the
hearing by said Court, his reasons for appeal specifically set
forth in writing, and shall give to said Minister at least ten
days' notice in writing of the time and place of such hearing.</p>


<p class="rop">COPYRIGHT.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_45" id="Rule_45"></a>45&mdash;A Certificate of Copyright may be procured by the
author of any map, book, chart, musical composition, print,
